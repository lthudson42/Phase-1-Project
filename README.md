# Portfolio Diversification Needed:
Commercial Aviation for Polaris Capital
Author: __[Liam Hudson](https://www.linkedin.com/in/liamhud-son)__

## Overview
This project investigates civil aviation accident dataset from the __[National Transportation Safety Board](https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/home.aspx)__ (NTSB), containing over 90,000 records of accident data between 1962 to 2023. Using data cleaning, analysis, and visualization techniques, the primary goal is to find the safest aircrafts based on a number of variables. These include the number of engines in each aircraft, its type of engine, injury severity, and injury count.

## Business Understanding
My business, Polaris Capital, wants to diversify its reach into new industries. I am tasked with investigating the potential risk of aircrafts and making three business suggestions that will help to make a decision that takes on as little risk as possible. I will base my suggestions on various components of an aircraft that have demonstrated low risk in the overall dataset of aviation accidents. Polaris Capital will use these suggestions to purchase and operate aircrafts for commercial and private enterprises.

## Data Understanding
The National Transportation Safety Board has a comprehensive dataset that records all civil aviation accidents from 1962 all the way to 2023. Each accident has a unique Event ID associated with aircraft components like make, model, and engine type. The data also records external variables like weather conditions, total injuries (i.e., minor, severe, fatal, and/or uninjured), and the phase of the flight.
